# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`.

Hi, I'm Shuya Chen! I'm a doctoral researcher at the department of Philosophy, Psychology and Language sciences in the University of Edinburgh. My supervisors are Professor [Vicky Chondrogianni](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/vicky-chondrogianni) and Dr. [Patrick Sturt](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/patrick-sturt). 

I am currently working on language development and processing of referring expressions in monolingual and bilingual Mandarin-speaking children. I hold an MSc (Distinction) in Developmental Linguistics from the University of Edinburgh with a dissertation in Anaphora resolution in Mandarin-speaking child heritage speakers. I earned a BA in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages at Shandong University, China. 

I also into photography, music and reading. See [my blog](https://shuya-chen.notion.site/shuya-chen/87439acbd07f4bd9aa99401eccd26a3c?v=3b31b90a6ccd4a4fbdca3a8b891067a2) for my thoughts, traveling notes and photos.
